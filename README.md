# Hello-world
This is me on the 3/02/2022 going through the github starter guide to begin my data science journey on freecodecamp.
I am a professionally trained pharmacist.
I live in nigeria.🌍🏡
I like making meanings out observations.
A friend sugested i have a look at datascience and see if a would like it.
lets say i was really sold on learning data science and applying it to healthcare.
So i started freecodecamp in a bid to learn the relevant skills.
By my reasonable estimate i think in 3 years time i will be proficient.
But then i'm trying to beat that timeframe.
Either ways i'm really proficent at 3 years tops.🐱‍🏍
I'm a product of opensource technology and will be always ready and willing to collaborate on that.
So keep an eye out for my relevant skill and hit me up, if you ever need my skill set on your team.
I love trading cryptocurrencies too, was terrible at first😂 but am getting better!!.😃
